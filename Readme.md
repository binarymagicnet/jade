# JADE

### *(Jadeâ€™s A Developing Experiment)*

### JADE is a set of include files with Macros and Functions that seeks to provide a Basic-Like way of creating c++ code.

### Compile with:  

`g++ -Wall demo.cpp -o demo `

### or if using clang, use:

`clang++ demo.cpp -o demo`

### This is a proof of concept using a BASIC-like syntax to program C++.
